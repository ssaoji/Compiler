// The goal of this program is to test peek and poke
// Normally you would use negatives to manipulate arguments, but there are none
// Therefore we are using positive values to manipulate the current stack
// Usually args are pushed onto stack just below the sp so thats why peek and poke with negatives are used
subr 0 main
// Stack 0 - 3
decl one int
decl two int
decl three int
decl four int

// Stack 4 - 9
